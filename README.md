# MerengoApp

This Android application is a not-official reader for [Merengő](https://fanfic.hu/merengo/) which is a website to upload fanfictions and original stories. Unfortunately Merengő does not have a mobile-friendly view, which makes it harder to read the stories when someone is on the way. The goal of this application to solve this problem and make the latest stories available for you, even if you are not sitting in front of your fancy laptop.

As you can leave critics at the stories on the original website, it's also a long term goal to encourage the readers to write at least a few words to the authors.

The app is written in Kotlin. All the planned features can be found in the Issue section, feel free to comment or add your own ideas.
